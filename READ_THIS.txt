# Hangman
Game hangman for my school project

If you are reading this it means I asked you to check my code by your self. Thank you for your attention. 
I used Visual Studio 2019 for this project and at least on my PC it works good(exept Guesse at once test, it works but a bit different than expected )

Here I'll add some console outputs
(I can proove them with screenshots)
